This repository is a storage area for old development snapshots of MOPAC and some miscellaneous testing data produced
during the development of the PM6 and PM7 models.
There is already an [archive](https://github.com/openmopac/mopac-archive/) with major version snapshots of the source code,
but this repo gives more fine-grained access to the history of MOPAC development in case some problems needed to be tracked
back to a specific time of implementation.
